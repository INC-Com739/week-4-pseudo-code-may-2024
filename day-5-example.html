    There are n colors of socks in a sock drawer. You want to find a pair of
    socks that are the same color. How many socks must you take out to be sure
    of having a pair of the same color?
  </p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    The maximum number of socks you need to take out to be sure of having a
    pair of the same color is n+1.

  <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
  <pre>
      Let n be the number of colors of socks in the drawer
      Let maxSocks = n + 1
      let maxSocks be the maximum number of socks you need to take out to be sure of having a pair of the same color 
      Return maxSocks
  </pre>
  <h2>Code</h2>
  <pre>
    function maxSocks(n) {
      let maxSocks = n + 1;
      return maxSocks;
    };     

      Result: <span id="code-result"></span>

    Discussion
  </h2>
  <p>
    The solution to this problem is simple. The maximum number of socks you need
    to take out to be sure of having a pair of the same color is n+1. This is
    because if you take out n socks, you could have n-1 different colors of
    socks. The next sock you take out will be the same color as one of the socks
    you have already taken out.</p>
